# Intro

I recently graduated from CSU Sacramento, and as a recent graduate, I am highly motivated and eager to embark on a career journey that allows me to apply the knowledge and skills I've acquired during my academic pursuits. I am enthusiastic about the opportunity to gain practical experience and contribute to a dynamic team. With a strong educational foundation and a passion for continuous learning, I am committed to making a positive impact in a professional setting while further honing my abilities and expertise.

# Some history

- At the age of 3 I was blessed with a precious little sister who I would cherish for the rest of my life
- For the majority of my life I have had a dog by my side enduring the many hardships and joys that come with life. More specificly a Beagle, Shelby and Taylor in the beginning being followed later by Bazil who I have currently, a precious child that I have come to love and would kill for. I have learned from my pets that life is extremely short and to cherrish every second especially those with them.
- My parents put me in soccer and baseball for 4 years at the age of 7 and another 7 years in kung fu at the age of 9.
- While they wanted me to be fit and active for the rest of my life, I ended up finding an interest in video games at the age of 9 when my best friend introduced me to online flash games in the computer lab in the elementary school. From then on at every break available I was to be found playing tag with my friends or playing games in the computer lab.
- At the age of 7 my Dad got a Gamecube which he let me play, this is where I found and interest in Zelda. We would play The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker and Twilight Princess where we would often get stuck and rely on a Guide book. After many years of games I would rarely need a guide though.
- At 9 my parents got me a DS because all my other friends had them and I found my love for POKEMON, for years after I would go around collecting the Pokemon collectable cards and sorting them into a couple of large binders
- From 9-13 was almost forced into playing the clarinet becuase I didn't want to join the chorus in elementary school which I very much regret.
- At 12 I found interest in Minecraft and would create a great many traps for my friends using thier commands and redstone circuits
- At the age of 12 I would slowly grow out of Minecraft and more towards mobile games: Plants Vs Zombies, Temple Run, AngryBirds, ..etc. Later on moving towards War Robots, PAD, MC5, World of Tanks, .. etc. Upgrading in highschool to Clash Royale, Pokemon Go and later on to Call of Duty, Genshin Imapact, Pokemon Unite, and TFT
- At 14 I took my first CS classes in a community college near my school during the summer where I learned basic C++
- At 16 my friends and I would get into Battle Royale games like Fortnite and Rules of Survivor, as well as League of Legends and Counter Strike a couple years earlier.
- 17+ I would still have passion for single player games and the occasional multiplayer with my friends
